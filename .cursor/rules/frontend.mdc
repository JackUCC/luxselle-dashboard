description: Frontend polish in src/. Toast + loading/empty states + mode-adaptive layouts.
globs:
  - src/**
  - packages/shared/**

## UX requirements
- Replace any alert() in main flows with toasts.
- Add consistent loading + empty states to Inventory, Sourcing, Evaluator, Invoices.
- Respect layout mode: use `useLayoutMode()` from `src/lib/LayoutModeContext.tsx` to adapt for Overview vs Sidecar.

## API usage
- Reads use apiGet. (Optional) add apiPost/apiPut/apiDelete and refactor 2 flows as template.

## Scope discipline
- Do not touch packages/server/ unless explicitly asked by the parent agent.
