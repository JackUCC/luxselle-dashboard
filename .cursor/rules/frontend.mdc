## UX requirements
- Replace any alert() in main flows with toasts.
- Add consistent loading + empty states to Inventory, Buying List, Supplier Hub, Sourcing, Evaluator.

## API usage
- Reads use apiGet. (Optional) add apiPost/apiPut/apiDelete and refactor 2 flows as template.

## Scope discipline
- Do not touch server/ unless explicitly asked by the parent agent.
