description: ALWAYS follow these Luxselle Supplier Engine repo rules.
alwaysApply: true

## Repo reality (do not change)
- NPM workspaces (NOT pnpm). Root scripts use npm --workspace.
- Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind in /src
- Backend: Express API in packages/server/src
- Shared: Zod schemas in packages/shared/src/schemas
- GSD (Get Shit Done) installed in .claude/ for spec-driven planning

## Product: Supplier Engine
- Two modes: **Overview** (full dashboard) and **Sidecar** (compact panel alongside supplier websites)
- Core features: Price Check (market price, max buy/bid), Landed Cost, Inventory awareness, Invoicing
- Removed: Buying List, Supplier Hub (pages, routes, backend APIs)

## Current goal (priority order)
1) Supplier Engine: Overview + Sidecar mode UX
2) Backend: consistent API error JSON + status transition validation
3) Frontend: toast (no alert), loading/empty states, mode-adaptive layouts
4) QA: keep e2e smoke passing

## Non-negotiables
- No large refactors. Small, targeted changes.
- Prefer types inferred from shared Zod schemas; avoid `any`.
- Every work chunk must output:
  1) changed files list
  2) how to test (exact commands)
  3) demo path (1-2 bullets)
