- Run npm run test and npm run test:e2e.
- E2E: `npm run test:e2e` is self-contained (Chromium auto-installed via pretest; dev stack via Playwright webServer). For cloud agents: use the env-setup prompt in AGENTS.md so `npm run test:e2e` works out-of-the-box.
- Fix regressions with minimal changes; no scope creep.
- Output: pass confirmation + fixes + changed files.
