## Accessibility (UX Auditor alignment)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text (lux palette: use lux-800/lux-900 on lux-50/lux-100 backgrounds; avoid low-contrast combos).
- Interactive elements must be keyboard operable and have visible focus (focus ring or equivalent).
- Images and icons that convey meaning need accessible names (alt, aria-label, or aria-labelledby).
- Forms: associate labels with inputs; surface errors clearly and accessibly (e.g. aria-describedby, live regions if dynamic).
- Prefer toasts for user feedback; avoid alert()/confirm() in main flows.
- When adding new UI, consider focus order and skip links for dense layouts (Overview vs Sidecar).
