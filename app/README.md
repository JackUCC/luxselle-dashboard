# Vercel deploy root

This folder is only for Vercel’s **Root Directory** setting when the UI won’t let you leave it blank.

**Vercel project ID:** `prj_tgxQea77MuP99i9oUQDPVkoJIs4W`

- **Root Directory:** set to **`app`** in Vercel project settings.
- Install and build run from the repo root; output is copied here so Vercel can serve it.

Do not add app source here; everything lives at repo root.
