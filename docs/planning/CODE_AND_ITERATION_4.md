# Iteration 4 Reference (Historical)

This file preserves high-level implementation notes from Iteration 4 while aligning terminology to the current Supplier Engine scope.

## What Iteration 4 Delivered

1. API error-shape consistency and route-level validation improvements.
2. Unit-test expansion for core business logic.
3. UX polish pass (toasts, loading states, empty states).
4. Stronger data handling and observability foundations.

## Historical Features Now Archived

Iteration 4 included legacy procurement and supplier-feed surfaces that were later removed in the Supplier Engine scope pivot. Those implementations are considered historical references, not active product scope.

## Lasting Outputs Still Relevant

1. Deterministic pricing and FX test patterns.
2. Sourcing transition validation patterns.
3. Structured API client and error handling conventions.
4. Cross-page QA expectations for operational reliability.

## Current Direction

Focus has moved to dual-mode Supplier Engine execution:

1. Overview mode for full operations.
2. Sidecar mode for in-flow buying decisions.

Future planning should use `PLAN.md`, `PRD.md`, and `STATUS_AND_PLAN.md` as the source of truth.
